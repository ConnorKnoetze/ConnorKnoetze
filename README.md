# Hi, I'm Connor 👋

Full‑stack web developer (Flask) • Systems & cryptography enthusiast • Java & C tinkerer

I build pragmatic web apps and backend systems — and I enjoy digging into low‑level code and crypto. Below are a few highlights of my work; feel free to explore the repos and get in touch.

- 🔭 Currently: building [Pet_Social_Media](https://github.com/ConnorKnoetze/Pet_Social_Media) — a full‑stack Flask app for sharing pet profiles and posts.
- ⚙️ Systems & crypto: implemented AES‑256‑CBC in C for use in local apps and experiments.
- 🛠️ Tools I use: Flask · Python · C · Java · JavaScript · Docker · GitHub Actions

## Selected projects

- [AES-256-CBC](https://github.com/ConnorKnoetze/AES-256-CBC) — C implementation of AES‑256 in CBC mode built for a password manager app. Low‑level, portable, and educational.  
- [Password_Manager](https://github.com/ConnorKnoetze/Password_Manager) — Java Swing password manager that uses the AES implementation to encrypt and locally store credentials. Focus on local security and usability.  
- [Pet_Social_Media](https://github.com/ConnorKnoetze/Pet_Social_Media) — Full‑stack web app built with Flask (Python) and a JS/CSS frontend. Shows backend design, auth, media uploads, and relational data.  
- [Image-Filters](https://github.com/ConnorKnoetze/Image-Filters) — Flask + Pillow app that lets users upload images and apply filters server‑side (good demo of file handling and image processing).  
- [connorknoetze.com](https://github.com/ConnorKnoetze/connorknoetze.com) — My portfolio website built with modern TypeScript tooling.

Other experiments: [235-recipe-website](https://github.com/ConnorKnoetze/235-recipe-website), [E2EE-Local-Group-Chat-App](https://github.com/ConnorKnoetze/E2EE-Local-Group-Chat-App), [paint-pygame](https://github.com/ConnorKnoetze/paint-pygame)

## Highlights & practices
- I write tests and use CI where practical — reproducible builds and passing pipelines are important to me.  
- For public tools and libraries: clear README, example usage, and licensed code.  
- For security projects: documented threat model and notes on limitations (every crypto project should include this).
